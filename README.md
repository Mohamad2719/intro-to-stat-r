Coursera Courses Projects

This course was about sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. I examined various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques was covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization.
